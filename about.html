                I'm Promise Jacob, a passionate Frontend Developer with a knack for creating user-friendly and
                accessible web interfaces. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy tackling

            <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p data-testid="test-about-goals">
                My primary goal in this internship program is to deepen my expertise in modern frontend frameworks like
                React and Vue, while mastering best practices in accessibility and performance optimization. I aim to
                contribute to real-world projects and collaborate with peers to enhance my teamwork and problem-solving
                skills.

            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p data-testid="test-about-confidence">
                While I'm confident in core frontend technologies, I sometimes struggle with advanced state management
                in complex applications and optimizing for cross-browser compatibility. I'm eager to improve these
                skills through hands-on experience and mentorship during this program.

                Keep pushing your boundaries and stay curious! Every challenge is an opportunity to grow. Remember to
                prioritize user experience and accessibility in every project, and never hesitate to ask for feedback to

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p data-testid="test-about-extra">
                I'm excited about the potential of web development to create inclusive digital spaces. Outside of
                coding, I find inspiration in reading novels and watching football, which help me stay creative and
                energized for my work.
